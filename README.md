## Introduction

**Rosetta 2.1** is a versatile text encryption and decryption tool designed to safeguard your messages by applying a simple yet effective method of character shifting. Developed with the goal of enhancing privacy and security, Rosetta 2.1 allows you to exchange confidential messages with friends while keeping them protected from prying eyes.

## Features

- **Text Encryption:** Encrypt messages by shifting the letters forward according to a specified shifting number.
- **Text Decryption:** Decrypt messages by shifting the letters backward, restoring the original text.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Rosetta 2.1 offers an intuitive and easy-to-use interface, making encryption and decryption a breeze.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.

## How to use it

1. Launch the application by executing 'rosetta.py'.
2. Choose the desired operation: Encryption or Decryption.
3. Enter the text you wish to encrypt or decrypt.
4. Specify the shifting number, which determines how much each character is shifted.
5. Click the "Encrypt" or "Decrypt" button to process your text.
6. Copy the result to securely share or save your encrypted/decrypted text.

## Algorithm

Rosetta 2.1 employs a simple character-shifting algorithm, where each letter in the text is shifted forward or backward in the alphabet based on the user-defined shifting number. This method provides a quick and effective way to protect your messages without the need for complex encryption techniques.
