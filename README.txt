I create Rosetta 2.1 during the WhatsApp privacy problem to make sure that my chat will not be exposed to public i use it between me and my friends,
Rosetta 2.1 is encrypting messages by shifting the letters forward according to the shifting number, and then decoding messages by shifting the letters backward.
I was inspired by the Rosetta 2 tool on first M1 Macs that used to make the non-M1 based application works on the M1 Macs 
as they decode the program and then recode it to be suitable for the M1 Macs.
